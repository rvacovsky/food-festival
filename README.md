# Food Festival üçî

## Description

Exercise to improve the performance of an established app. Utilized minify, lazy-loading, then webpack module bundling.

## User Story

As an organizer of a food festival, I want my festival application to be deployed so customers can use it. I want a fast and performant mobile-friendly application since users will be accessing it on their phones while at the festival.

## Acceptance Criteria

When the user opens the food festival app with or without an internet connection, they will be able to access data such as the festival schedule and vendor locations.
